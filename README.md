# Termux-Command-List
You can download Termux from playstore or use it in Bluestacks in your PC. But I recommend to use it in mobile phone as it is much more easiler to use with less error. In PC there can be some errors while installing packages.

# Update and Upgrade Termux packages
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y 

# Clear Termux screen
clear

# Delete files and folder
rm -rf Document

# Install package
pkg install package name
